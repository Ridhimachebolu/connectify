# connectify

Motivation for Connectify: Connectify was conceived with a clear motivation: to address the unique social networking needs of college students. Traditional social media platforms lack the specificity and privacy features required for college communities. With Connectify, we aimed to create a platform tailored to the collegiate environment, fostering connections, collaboration, and community among students.
